2.  A database would be used if there will be multiple users accessing the information at the same time.
 While a text file would be more appropriate if there is no potential for simultaneous access.


3. SQL is a declarative language so rather than having to 'explain' step by step procedures you can 'declare' what you want to do.
Rather than focus on how the database should find information we can focus simply on what information we want.

4. Databases allow a user to create, read, update, and delete information in a stored location that has persistence.
The information is stored in a binary file format so its would be rather difficult for a user to read or interpret.
So a database also includes a more user-friendly GUI for the user to manipulate and read the information, while
internal processes quickly handle the translation from one to the other to retrieve and serve the information as needed.


5.
A table is effectively the 'parent' in the relational aspect of the others within its context.ex: Inventory
A column is a verticle slice of grouped information. ex: Item Quantity
A row is a horizontal slice of information representing a whole. ex: All of the information pertaining to ONE item.
A value is the data within each cell of the table. ex: "Turkey"
